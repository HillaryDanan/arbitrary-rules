The wing's curved shape (airfoil) causes air to move faster over the top surface than the bottom, creating lower pressure above the wing and higher pressure below. This pressure difference generates lift that overcomes the plane's weight.\n\nThe four main forces acting on an aircraft are:\n- **Lift** (upward force from the wings)\n- **Weight** (downward gravitational force)\n- **Thrust** (forward force from engines)\n- **Drag** (backward resistance from air)\n\nWhen lift exceeds weight and thrust overcomes drag, the plane can take off and maintain flight. The pilot controls the plane by adjusting these forces through various control surfaces like ailerons, elevators, and rudders.",

During rest periods, fish typically become less active, reduce their movement, and may hover motionless in the water or rest on the bottom. Their breathing slows down, and they become less responsive to their surroundings, similar to how other animals behave during sleep. Different fish species have varying sleep patterns - some are more active during the day and rest at night, while others are nocturnal. This rest period is essential for their health and helps them conserve energy.",
